Proudley present- No hassle website creation. 
# Introduction
LeapThat has created a technical standart under which our development proccess aims to minimise tech related difficulties. Our main purpose was to maximise conversion and nullify any difficulty a user might have while setting up his website. By using content allready typed in by the user from any platform- we use the thechnucal skills the user allready posses (managing a social account,a blog or any other content media) we simplify the website creation proccess to the bare minimum.  
In the following document I will lay down the method in which we use to score the difficulties that arise from any change of scope. I hope this will help anyone who reads it to better the user exeperience and simplify humanity's approach to technology.
## Abstract
Our main target of this application is to create a one click solution for website creation. As the current user espect for a one click service in other fields (Directions, Taxi lift, Shopping etc) that has been disrupted, so he will want the same service for website creation. There is available technology that has disrupted this market considerably (Wix, WordPress etc)  but none for today’s user- a 0 complication solution. Our work assumption define the target user as a user that has already familiarised himself to some sort of digital content platform (social network, blog, business directory, etc) so the app can pull and analyse user content. So if he has any data at all, the app will create a website. By tapping to existing data source we save the end user any need of typing in the data himself or designing appearances. 

 The main consideration regarding the product development considers three main subjects-
Complication meter- SPI -We have developed an internal meter that looks on the user experience as a Simple as Possible Interface (SPI in the rest of this document) and counted each screen redirect as 10 points, each button to push 20 points, each action to be done 30 points and each choice to make 50. Login process will cost 70 PSI (name, password and button) under this meter for example.
Under that perspective there are three main features to reduce SPI points-

Integrations - Using existing API’s the user needs only to login (or just press a logo) in order to create a website. Social networks and business directories data is stored in an accessible format and easy to reformat by custom scripts to a modern template. (website creation SPI costs- 10 SPI- one click if logged in, -80 PSI- if requires login)
Web crawler - For using a website as a content source the user will have to copy a URL and paste it to a designated field in the Leapthat app. The website HTML/CSS format holds the data in an easy and mostly standard structure that he app will know to rearrange in a modern template. (website creation SPI costs- 110 SPI- )

Automation - In order to prevent any user choices or damaging PSI rank we’ve the following automations:
Integrations - Using existing API’s the user needs only to login (or just press a logo) in order to create a website. Social networks and business directories data is stored in an accessible format and easy to reformat by custom scripts to a modern template. (website creation SPI costs- 30 SPI- one click if logged in, and redirect to new site -100 PSI- if requires login)
External analysis tools- LeapThat application uses Google and Amazon services in order to analyse user content, label it. This services analyse images and texts and the LeapThat algorithm uses those in order to better understand user content type, atmosphere and purpose. This allows a PSI free design process so the end result will be as close to user intent as possible and require the user no further alterations.

Our second consideration revolves scalability. The ease of use and diverse data sources means that the LeapThat application can approach the global user population. While designing it to massive use we considered a minimum use limit of 200MIL users (unique website owner)  to reach sustenance.  That means that the application should hold infinite calculation power. Much like Facebook or other software giants the app is using Amazon and Google services for hosting File Buckets which the app uses as repository. The app main generator and most of the rendering happens serverless on the user browser. The completed generated website is stored as HTML static file that is available on the web. 

So by pending on familiar, scalable infrastructure, keeping services and host as files rather than active on premise servers the app can grow exponentially and without constraints.
Our third consideration is the focus on marketing and time to market. As the internet offers endless sources of content they are rapidly changing and new looks, technology and standards are getting developed continuously. The development time frame had revolved hitting the most widespread content source and from there to work down. Development will happen continuously for the application lifetime re releasing new templates and adapting to new sources. So each version release should represent the current most advanced technology (or one generation less) and fashion in website design.
